# Build your own NFT using ERC-721 

In this repo I have made an NFT, to build the smart contract we would be using Hardhat.

# To deploy in your terminal type:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
Now save the NFT Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it.

# Verify on Etherscan
Go to Goerli Etherscan and search for the address that was printed.
If the address opens up on etherscan, you have deployed your first NFT ðŸŽ‰
Go to the transaction details by clicking on the transaction hash, check that there was a token transferred to your address
